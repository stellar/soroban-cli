# Soroban Init Template

This repository can be used as a template for creating a Soroban project. You can either clone this repository directly, or soon will be able to use the `soroban init` command from the soroban CLI. This first iteration just creates a bare-bones Rust project setup as a Rust workspace, but in the future it will also include options for creating an frontend that is able to interact with contracts in the `contracts` directory as well.
